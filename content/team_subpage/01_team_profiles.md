The AusTraits project received **[investment](https://doi.org/10.47486/DP720)** from 2021-2023 from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS).. This funding allows a broad team of ARDC grant partners to expand AusTraits data coverage and enhance data quality.
