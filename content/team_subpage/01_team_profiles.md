The AusTraits project received **[investment](https://doi.org/10.47486/DP720)** from 2021-2023 from the Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC). The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy (NCRIS). This funding allows a broad team of ARDC grant partners to expand AusTraits data coverage and enhance data quality. 

If you would like to contribute data or expertise to AusTraits please **[contact us](/#08_contact)** or read more about our current **[work packages](/#03_expand)**.
