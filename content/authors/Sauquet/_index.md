### Biography

Hervé is a Senior Research Scientist at the Royal Botanic Gardens and Domain Trust in Sydney. His work focuses on the macroevolution of flowering plants, including broad-scale patterns of diversification and floral evolution. He is the lead coordinator of the international eFLOWER project and the developer of its subtending PROTEUS global database of plant traits (mostly floral traits). He is also a phylogeneticist, currently involved in several large-scale phylogenomic projects, including the Australian Angiosperm Tree of Life (AAToL) phylogenomic project of the Genomics for Australian Plants (GAP) initiative, and a systematic botanist with specific expertise in various plant groups (incl. Magnoliidae, Proteaceae).
