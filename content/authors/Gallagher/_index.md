### Biography

Rachel is a Senior Lecturer in Plant Ecology and Conservation Science at Macquarie University. Rachael works to ensure that plants are protected and recognised for their vital contribution to society. She runs a research program investigating plant diversity and adaptation, including experimental and field studies of plant responses to key threatening processes such as climate change. Rachaelâ€™s research draws on national and international initiatives on plant traits and ranges, several of which she contributes to directly as co-curator of the national AusTraits database. She uses these rich sources of data to inform continental and global scale studies in plant biogeography. Rachael is a current member of the Commonwealth Threatened Species Scientific Committee.
