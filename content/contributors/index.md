## **[Contact us](/#08_contact)** if you have data to contribute.  

AusTraits continues to integrate both newly collected and legacy datasets, with future Zenodo releases planned.  

We also accept transcriptions of reference books, classic works, and taxonomic monographs.


**This project would not be possible without all the contributions from researchers all around Australia. We are thankful for every contribution no matter how large or small.**

See **[Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3568417)** for a full list of researchers who contributed data and expertise to AusTraits.
