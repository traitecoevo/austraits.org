From 2021-2023 we are funded by a Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) grant through their <ins>**[Australian Data Partnerships program](https://ardc.edu.au/project/austraits/)**</ins>. This support allows us to expand AusTraits data coverage and enhance data quality, allowing AusTraits to emerge as a national data asset. 

A team of 30 researchers from across 25 unversities, government departments, and NGOs are working together to achieve this outcome.
