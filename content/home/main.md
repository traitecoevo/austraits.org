AusTraits is an open-source, harmonized database of Australian plant trait data. It synthesises data on 448 traits across 28640 taxa from field campaigns, published literature, taxonomic monographs, and individual taxon descriptions. Begun in 2016 as an initiative between three lab groups, it has grown to be the largest collation of plant trait data for Australian plants.

AusTraits integrates plant trait data collected by researchers from diverse disciplines, including functional plant biology, plant physiology, plant taxonomy, and conservation biology. By harmonizing and error checking values, linking all AusTraits data entries to detailed metadata, including trait and trait values definitions, AusTraits is a resource future researchers can trust and use for their own research agendas with little additional filtering or manipulations.

An AusTraits R package accompanies the current first public release of AusTraits, facilitating the download and use of the AusTraits database.

Over the coming years AusTraits aims to grow into a national data asset, by merging in additional legacy datasets, soliciting newly collected datasets from diverse research labs, further developing the database structure, and enhancing data quality through the publication of trait definitions and continued development of error checking protocols. During this timeframe, AusTraits will also initiate the public sharing of the data resource, establishing an API and distributing the data through a selection of biodiversity portals.
