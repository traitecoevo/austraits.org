### Growing AusTraits into a national data asset
From 2021-2023 we are funded by a Australian Research Data Commons (ARDC) grant through their Australian Data Partnerships program. The <ins>**[ARDC investment](https://ardc.edu.au/project/austraits/)**</ins>, together with co-investment from our 19 partner institutions, will expand AusTraits' data coverage and enhance data quality, allowing AusTraits to emerge as a national data asset. The AusTraits <ins>**[core team](#04_team)**</ins> and broader <ins>**[team of ARDC partners](team/)**</ins> are jointly working on a collection of work packages to achieve this goal.

### Contributing new data to AusTraits
To contribute trait data to AusTraits, please fill in the <ins>**[contact box](contact/)**</ins> below. Briefly, we require your data contribution as a spreadsheet in conjunction with accompanying metadata.

A <ins>**[vignette](http://traitecoevo.github.io/austraits.build/articles/adding_data.html)**</ins> offers a detailed glance at the data entry process, with introductory sections on ideal submission formats near the top of the article.

We also accept any legacy datasets, either from your archives or transcribed from published data sources.

### Formalising vocabulary
The AusTraits team will be leading a series of workshops over the coming two years to review and more fully document trait definitions and allowable trait values (*terms* for categorical variables and *ranges* for continuous variables) used to build AusTraits. Our first <ins>**[workshop](post/workshop1/)**</ins> will review trait definitions associated with seeds and germination.

### Enhanced access options
The AusTraits team is in the process of developing a project API. Once completed, the database will be accessable by querying the API or through biodiversity portals. Coming in 2022.
