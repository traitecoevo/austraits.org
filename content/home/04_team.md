**Our core AusTraits team is supported in maintaining, expanding, and enhancing AusTraits by a team of **[ARDC project grant partners](team_subpage/)**.**
**The creation of the AusTraits database was only possible because of the **[researchers](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3568417)** who contributed data to this endeavor.**
