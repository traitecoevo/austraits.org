Over the past year we have conducted two workshops to refine and document the trait definitions used to build AusTraits. These workshops have brought together researchers from different disciplines, ranging from plant ecologists to systematists, who use AusTraits to answer correspondingly different research questions The forum allows us to jointly determine the scope of traits, trait definitions and allowable trait values that meet everyone's research needs.

The first workshop was focused on a collection of traits related to seeds, germination and seedlings.

The second workshop was focused on a collection of traits related to plant growth form and morphological leaf traits.

In early 2023 we will be holding a workshop on traits that shape plant fire response and conducting some informal reviews of traits capturing physiological function.
