AusTraits continues to integrate both newly collected and legacy datasets, with future Zenodo releases planned.

We also accept transcriptions of reference books, classic works, and taxonomic monographs.

**This project would not be possible without all the contributions from researchers all around Australia. We are thankful for every contribution no matter how large or small.**

See [**Zenodo**](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3568417) for a full list of researchers who contributed data and expertise to AusTraits.
