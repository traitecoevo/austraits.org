### Biography

Cecile is a research scientist and the leader of the Species Interactions & Community Ecology team at the Australian National Herbarium (CSIRO, Canberra). Her research background is on the Systematics and Evolution of fungi, in particular lichenised fungi, including the family Verrucariaceae. She has used molecular phylogenetics to test generic delimitation and better understand trait evolution within this morphologically and ecologically diverse group of fungi. She currently works on the systematics of various Australian lichens. Her current interests also include high-throughput herbarium genomics, the molecular basis of fungal-algal interactions in lichens, and biological soil crusts.
