### AusTraits funding
The AusTraits project is currently receiving investment from the Australian Research Data Commons **[(ARDC)](https://ardc.edu.au)** through their **[Plant Research Data Commons](https://ardc.edu.au/planet-research-data-commons/)** program. From 2021-2023 AusTraits received ARDC **[investment](https://doi.org/10.47486/DP720)** through their **[Australian Data Partnerships](https://ardc.edu.au/program/australian-data-partnerships/)** program, to grow the database into a National Data Asset. The ARDC is funded by the National Collaborative Research Infrastructure Strategy **[(NCRIS)](https://www.education.gov.au/ncris)**. The AusTraits **[core team](#04_team)** and broader **[team of ARDC partners](team_subpage/)** are jointly working on a collection of work packages to achieve this goal.

### Contributing new data to AusTraits
To contribute trait data to AusTraits, please **[contact](#08_contact)** us. Briefly, we require your data contribution as a spreadsheet in conjunction with accompanying metadata, as described on our **[GitHub repository](https://github.com/traitecoevo/austraits.build#contributing-to-austraits)**.
We also accept any legacy datasets, either from your archives or transcribed from published data sources.

### Expanding coverage of key traits
During our previous project phase we created near-complete datasets for three core traits, plant growth form, life history, and woodiness. Our success in sourcing information for nearly all Australian vascular plants has guided our decision to select additional traits to manually gap fill. Through a series of workshops in 2024-2025 we will select traits deemed essential for assessing speciesâ€™ responses to disturbance (especially from fire), climate change (especially to drought, extreme temperatures), and reproduction (e.g. pollination traits, flower colour).

### Explore utility of trait data for determining species' susceptibility to threats
A clear application of AusTraits data is to determine workflows for species' trait values to be used in conservation planning and management decisions and for priority research questions in the face of climate and environmental change. In addition to expanding trait coverage, AusTraits team is currently exploring how trait data can help inform threatened species' susceptibilities to various threats.

### Output synthetic data summaries
Between 2024-2026 we will be developing a workflow to release species and species-by-location trait data summaries as core AusTraits outputs. This translation of raw plant trait data to synthesised outputs ensures reliable data and information products are available to form the building blocks for environmental assessments across diverse research sectors.

### Offer guidance to traits.build users
The **[traits.build](https://github.com/traitecoevo/traits.build)** R package offers an off-the-shelf workflow for building trait databases for any taxonomic group or collection of traits. Our extensive **[book](https://traitecoevo.github.io/traits.build-book/)** offers tutorials and exhaustive descriptions of how to build a new database. However, many users will wish to pair these resources with some one-on-one help to start a new database, and the AusTraits team is available to provide guidance to traits.build users.
